# Oauth Stubber

A quick landing page to grab oauth codes for commandline apps. Feel free to fork. 

Set your callback url to: https://grynn.github.io/oauthcallback/

## Why?

I've used a few commandline apps that require you to generate a callback url and paste an Oauth code into it. This is a silly page to make copying it a bit easier.
