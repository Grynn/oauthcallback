# Oauth Stubber

A quick landing page to grab oauth codes for commandline apps.

A _tiny_ (less than 100 lines) web page to be used as an Oauth callback/redirect URI.

Feel free to fork this so you can guarantee the URL will always point to this code.

If you're not worried about that, set your callback URL to `https://james-firth.github.io/oauthcallback/`

## Why?

I've used a few commandline apps that require you to generate a callback url and paste an Oauth code into it. This is a silly page to make copying it a bit easier.
